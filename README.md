# Devu

DEVU Developer Utilities - useful shell functions.

## Installation

This `1.0.0` release just includes a collection of shell functions defined in `bin/devu.sh`

Later version will create a more robust gem with executables and the power of Ruby, but for now it is just a shell script.

```
gem install devu
cp <install_dir>/bin/devu.sh ~/devu.sh

# In .bashrc, .zshrc, etc...
source ~/devu.sh
```

## Usage

```
$ devu # => output help and usage
```

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
